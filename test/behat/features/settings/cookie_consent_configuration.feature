In order to enable cookie consent
As an admin
I need to be able to enable it via a switch

Scenario: Turning the switches on and off on Cookie consent page (Bug 1431569)
 Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
 And I choose "Cookie Consent" in "Configure site" from administration menu
 And I set the following fields to these values:
 | Enable Cookie Consent | 1 |
 And I press "Save changes"
 And I should see "Cookie Consent enabled"
 And I should see "Got it!"
