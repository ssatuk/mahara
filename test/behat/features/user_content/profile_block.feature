As a user
I want to add a profile block to my page
And ensure it displays my name, email and profile picture correctly
Additionally, this is a test for adding/deleting a profile picture

Scenario: Profile block displays my information correctly (Bug 1677929)
  Given I log in as "UserA" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
  And I choose "Profile pictures" from account menu
  # Add profile image
  And I attach the file "Image2.png" to "Profile picture"
  And I set the field "Image title" to "Angela"
  And I press "Upload"
  And I select the radio "Set default for \"Angela\""
  And I press "Set default"
  Then I should see "Default profile picture set successfully"
  # Add profile block to page
  And I choose "Pages and collections" in "Create" from main menu
  And I follow "Page UserA_01"
  And I follow "Edit"

  And I check "Last name"
  And I set the field "Angela" to "1"
  And I set the field "UserA@example.org" to "1"
  And I press "Save"
  # Confirm information displays on page
  And I display the page
  Then I should see "First name: Angela"
  And I should see "Last name: User"
  And I should see "Email address: UserA@example.org"
  # This checks an image is displayed, not the specific image
  And I should see images within the block "Profile information"

  And I select the radio "Mark \"Angela\" for deletion"
  And I press "Delete"
