  Scenario: Group users submit content to the group and group admin checks who is still to submit content
    # UserA submits a collection to the group
    Given I log in as "UserA" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
    And I choose "Groups" in "Engage" from main menu
    When I click on "GroupA"
    And I scroll to the base of id "groupviewlist"
    And I select "Collection UserA_01" from "Submit for assessment"
    And I press "Submit"
    And I press "Yes"
    Then I should see "Collection submitted"
    And I log out

    # UserB submits a page to the group
    Given I log in as "UserB" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
    And I choose "Groups" in "Engage" from main menu
    When I click on "GroupA"
    And I scroll to the base of id "groupviewlist"
    And I select "Page UserB_02" from "Submit for assessment"
    And I press "Submit"
    And I press "Yes"
    Then I should see "Page submitted"
    And I log out

    # UserC didn't submit anything so should appear on the need to do submissions list
    Given I log in as "groupAdmin" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
    And I choose "Groups" in "Engage" from main menu
    When I click on "GroupA"
    And I scroll to the base of id "groupviewlist"
    Then I should see "Cecilia User" in the "Members without a submission to the group" property
