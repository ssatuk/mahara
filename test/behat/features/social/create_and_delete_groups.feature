Feature: Delete groups
    In order to delete a group
    As an admin I need to create groups
    So I can verify they can be deleted successfully

Scenario: Creating groups and deleting them (Selenium)
    # Log in as "Admin" user
    Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
    # Create a Friend invitation only group
    And I choose "Groups" in "Engage" from main menu
    And I follow "Create group"
    And I fill in "Group name" with "Admin Test Group"
    And I disable the switch "Open"
    And I enable the switch "Friend invitations"
    And I press "Save group"
    # Create Request only group

    And I fill in "End date" with "2015/06/15 03:30"
    And I press "Save group"
    # Verify "Group info" block exists
    And ".bt-groupinfo" "css_element" should be visible
    And I should see "Created" in the ".bt-groupinfo" "css_element"

    # Create Open group
