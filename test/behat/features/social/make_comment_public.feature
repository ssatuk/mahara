@javascript @core @comments

Feature: As a user I want to make just one comment from a list public (Bug 1729423)
    so others can see that comment,
    while the rest of the list remains private

Background:

  Given the following "users" exist:
    | username | password | email | firstname | lastname | institution | authname | role |
    | UserA | Kupuh1pa! | UserA@example.org | Angela | User | mahara | internal | user |
    | UserB | Kupuh1pa! | UserB@example.org | Bob | User | mahara | internal | user |

  And the following "pages" exist:
    | title | description | ownertype | ownername |
    | Page UserA_01 | Page 01| user | UserA |
    | Page UserA_02 | Page 02 | user | UserA |
    | Page UserA_03 | Page 03 | user | UserA |

  And the following "collections" exist:
    | title | description | ownertype | ownername | pages |
    | Collection UserA_01 | Collection 01 | user | UserA | Page UserA_01, Page UserA_02 |

  # make following comments exist option?
