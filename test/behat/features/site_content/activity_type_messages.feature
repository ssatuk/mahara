Feature: Admins are allowed to see more types of messages than a regular person
In order to see what types are visible to me
As an admin/student
So I can filter messages

Background:
 Given the following "users" exist:
     | username | password | email | firstname | lastname | institution | authname | role |
     | UserA | Kupuh1pa! | UserA@example.org | Angela | User | mahara | internal | member |


Scenario: Selection options to filter messages (Bug 1433342)
 # Log in as "Admin"
 Given I log in as "admin" with password "Kupuh1pa!"
 And I choose "People" from administration menu
 And I follow "Angela"
 And I follow "Send message"
 And I fill in the following:
 | Subject   | Hi there |
 | Message   | This is a test message |
 And I press "Send message"
 And I log out
