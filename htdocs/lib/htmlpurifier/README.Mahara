HTMLPurifier in Mahara
======================

Website: http://www.htmlpurifier.org/
Version: 4.12.0

This library is used by clean_html, to strip malicious HTML from user-generated
content.

Changes:
We only use the /library/HTMLPurifier folder from the download, however the configuration change below requires a script that depends on some other code to be run, so for a start grab /extras, /library and /maintenence from the download.

Steps to update:
- Download latest .zip file and extract somewhere locally (not in mahara directory)

- Add the change to HTMLPurifier/Filter/ExtractStyleBlocks.php (from commit: a485b22c302f862e1bfd4254320a837418c24511)
  Add in the HTMLPurifier/ConfigSchema/schema/Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.PreserveCSS.txt
  Allows CSS comments to not be stripped out.
  Used in custom skins.

- Add the change to HTMLPurifier/URIFilter/SafeIframe.php (from commit: f11abcae0b426b1eb5023f8fc21b0f9a1a9dcb4b)
  To allow protocol relative urls
  Prevents HTTP iframes on HTTPS sites

- Go into maintenence/generate-schema-cache.php directory and run
  php generate-schema-cache.php

- Copy all the content from library/ to htdocs/lib/htmlpurifier/
