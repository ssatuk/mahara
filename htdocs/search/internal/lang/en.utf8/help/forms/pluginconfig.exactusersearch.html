<h3>Exact people searches</h3>

<p>If your site has a lot of people and uses a PostgreSQL database,
people searches will be faster with exact people searching enabled.
The setting will still work with MySQL databases, but is unlikely
to significantly increase search performance.</p>

<p>However, partial matches on profile fields will not return results,
so if for example you have a person called "Nigel", then typing "Nige"
into the search box will not find that person.</p>
